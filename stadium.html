    <p style="color: white"> Lord's is widely referred to as the Home of Cricket and
        is home to the world's oldest sporting<br> museum. Lord's today is not on its original site;
        it is the third of three grounds that Lord established <br>between 1787 and 1814. His first ground,
        now referred to as Lord's Old Ground, was where Dorset<br> Square now stands.</p>

    <p style="color: white"> The redesigned stadium occupies 63 acres of land, with three entry points 
        as compared to one in the <br>old stadium, with a metro line at one of the entry points. 
        It contains 76 corporate boxes that can hold 25 persons each, a 55-room clubhouse,
         an Olympic sized swimming pool, and four dressing rooms.
